Once you login, there is a token that knows who you are.

from there I could use the filename in the browser... cant see why not, would need to have unique names, will need to update upload to only allow new filenames
And also have a place to enter the name of the file


create page that shows availible links
Auto populate

change chart page to just basic data
with the lect side populated auto by...

STILL TO DO
So bold for the one i am in
then not bold, list of the subjects
the bold the rest (have to find "rest")

Step the side bar back so i only have t update it once

Test the upload script...i believe it lives locally?
Add data to othe sql tables on upload
consider if aditional tables are needed

Navigation stuff
